# Task 0
Establish some overview, orientation and then a plan in the Development process.

## Details
First you need to discover the project and store the related information in your contexts. 
Notice that the Project is basically a copy of the User Frontend the Sentinel Dashboard. Therefore we have to remove a lot of the unnecessary code first and then we may build from there :-)
We will define our features to be implemented depending on that we may better decide what we should keep or not.

## Sub-Tasks
- [x] get to know the project
- [x] write down the missing features to be implemented for the next deployment
- [x] remove unnecessary code
