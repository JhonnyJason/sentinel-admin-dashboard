# Task 2
Implement ForexScore Playground - search FocusPair

## Details
We have a specific Set ot ForexPairs available (actually we have all combinations available but we want to only consider the list in the config `shownCurrencyPairLabels`). Now We need Combobox Search Element on the Top-left where we choose one Currency pair to focus on. 
We had such a Combobox Implemented somewhereelse so I added the relevant sample code from there in the forexscoreframemodule. The files with the sample code is: comboboxfun.coffee seasonality.styl and seasonalityframe.pug

## Sub-Tasks
- [ ] add relevant structure in the forexscoreframemodule/forexscoreframe.pug
- [ ] add relevant style in the forexscoreframemodule/styles.styl
- [ ] adjust the code in comboboxfun.coffee and use it from forexscoreframemodule/forexscoreframemodule.coffee
- [ ] test the implementation and fix the issues
