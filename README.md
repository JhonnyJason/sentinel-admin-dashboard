# The Sentinel Admin Dashboard

This is the UI of the Administrator of the EWAG Sentinel.
It's main purpose is to enable the Administrator to control the System.

Features:
 - Secure but hassle-free login for the administrators
 - Playground to Experiment with ForexScore parameters
 - User Management
 - Other features to be defined later :-)

## The EWAG Sentinel System
We have separated out a few componets:
- Sentinel Dashboard (The public Interface for the Users)
- Sentinel Access Manager (Does the login and validates if a user has access to Data -> grants or revokes access for some timeframe on the Backend and the Datahub)
- Sentinel Backend (Does the Makrodata aggregation)
- Sentinel Datahub (Does historic EOD data aggregation)
- Sentinel Admin Dashboard ( This UI project :-) )
